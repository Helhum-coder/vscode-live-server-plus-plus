- `BRANCH_DIVERGENCE_RESOLUTION.md` (added) - Documentation for handling branch divergence

## Merge Recommendation

**Merge Method**: Fast-forward merge  
**Conflicts**: None  
**Risk Level**: Low

The pull request can be safely merged using GitHub's standard merge options:
- ✅ **Create a merge commit** (recommended for preserving history)
- ✅ **Squash and merge** (if you want a single commit)
- ✅ **Rebase and merge** (for linear history)

All three merge strategies are safe to use as there are no conflicts.

## Conclusion

The branch divergence has been analyzed and documented. The current branch is ahead of the base branch with additional documentation. No file conflicts exist, and the merge can proceed safely.

The added documentation (`BRANCH_DIVERGENCE_RESOLUTION.md`) provides guidance for handling similar situations in the future.
